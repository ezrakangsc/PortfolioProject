Hacker News Moderating
2. Recent studies have found that online forums tend to be dominated by a small percentage of their users (1-9-90 Rule). Is this true of Hacker News? Is a small percentage of Hacker News submitters taking the majority of the points?
First, find the total score of all the stories.

SELECT SUM(score)
FROM hacker_news;


3. Next, we need to pinpoint the users who have accumulated a lot of points across their stories.
Find the individual users who have gotten combined scores of more than 200, and their combined scores.
GROUP BY and HAVING are needed!

SELECT user, SUM(score)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY user
HAVING SUM(score) > 200
ORDER BY 2 DESC;


4. Then, we want to add these users’ scores together and divide by the total to get the percentage.
Add their scores together and divide it by the total sum. Like so:
SELECT (1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0) / 6.0;
So, is Hacker News dominated by these users?

SELECT (517 + 309 + 304 + 282) / 6366.0;


5. Oh no! While we are looking at the power users, some users are rickrolling — tricking readers into clicking on a link to a funny video and claiming that it links to information about coding.
-- The url of the video is:
-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
--How many times has each offending user posted this link?

SELECT user, COUNT(*) 
FROM hacker_news
WHERE url LIKE '%watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

-- Which sites feed Hacker News? 

6. Hacker News stories are essentially links that take users to other websites.
Which of these sites feed Hacker News the most:
GitHub, Medium, or New York Times?

SELECT CASE
   WHEN url LIKE '%github.com%' THEN 'GitHub'
   WHEN url LIKE '%medium.com%' THEN 'Medium'
   WHEN url LIKE '%nytimes.com%' THEN 'New York Times'
   ELSE 'Other'
  END AS 'Source',
  COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1;

What's the best time to post a story?

8. Every submitter wants their story to get a high score so that the story makes it to the front page, but…
What’s the best time of the day to post a story on Hacker News?
Before we get started, let’s run this query and take a look at the timestamp column:

SELECT timestamp
FROM hacker_news
LIMIT 10;


9. SQLite comes with a strftime() function - a very powerful function that allows you to return a formatted date.
It takes two arguments:
  strftime(format, column)
Let’s test this function out:

What do you think this does? Open the hint if you’d like to learn more.
Returns only the hours for the timestamp  

SELECT timestamp,
   strftime('%H', timestamp)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1
LIMIT 20;

10.  Let’s write a query that returns three columns:
  1.The hours of the timestamp
  2.The average score for each hour
  3.The count of stories for each hour

SELECT 
   strftime('%H', timestamp) AS 'hours', 
   AVG(score),
   COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;


11. Let’s edit a few things in the previous query:
  1.Round the average scores (ROUND()).
  2.Rename the columns to make it more readable (AS).
  3.Add a WHERE clause to filter out the NULL values in timestamp.
Take a look at the result again:
What are the best hours to post a story on Hacker News?
Hours 7am, 6-8pm

SELECT 
   strftime('%H', timestamp) AS 'hours', 
   ROUND(AVG(score), 2) as 'avg_score',
   COUNT(*) AS 'number_of_stories'
FROM hacker_news
WHERE timestamp IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
